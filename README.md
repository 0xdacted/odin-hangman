# odin-hangman
This simple Hangman game built in Ruby selects a word between 5-12 letters long from a text file. On each turn, you can guess one letter. To win, you must find all the letters in the word before using 15 guesses.


In addition, you may choose to save a game on any turn. When initializing a game, you can choose to load a previously saved game or start a new game.
